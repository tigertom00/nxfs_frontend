# NXFS Frontend Refactoring TODO

This document tracks the comprehensive refactoring tasks identified during TypeScript cleanup and API architecture migration from monolithic to domain-driven structure.

## üî• High Priority - TypeScript Migration Completion

### Remove Legacy Types Directory
- [ ] **Delete `/src/types/` directory entirely** - All types now live within their respective API domains
- [ ] **Update any remaining imports** from `/src/types/` to new domain-specific locations
- [ ] **Verify no broken imports** after deletion

### Complete Type Unification

- [ ] **Replace all 'as any' type assertions** with proper typing
- [ ] **Ensure consistent Task/TaskFormData usage** across all components
- [ ] **Standardize pagination response handling** across all API domains

### Authentication Type Safety
- [ ] **Add comprehensive null checks** for user authentication in remaining components
- [ ] **Standardize theme handling patterns** across all pages
- [ ] **Ensure consistent loading state management** in authentication flows

## üèóÔ∏è API Architecture Improvements

### Missing API Methods
- [ ] **Blog Media API** - Add upload, delete, and management endpoints
- [ ] **Advanced Task Filtering** - Implement category, project, date range filters
- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Add batch task updates and deletions
- [ ] **User Management API** - Complete CRUD operations for admin users

### API Response Standardization
- [ ] **Create typed pagination helpers** for consistent Django REST Framework pagination handling
- [ ] **Implement response interceptors** for automatic error handling and toast notifications
- [ ] **Add request/response logging** for development environment debugging
- [ ] **Standardize error response formats** across all API domains

### Real-time Features Enhancement
- [ ] **Socket.IO type definitions** - Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] **Real-time task updates** - Implement live task status synchronization
- [ ] **User presence indicators** - Show online users in collaborative features
- [ ] **Live notifications system** - Real-time alerts for task assignments and updates

## üì± Component Architecture Refactoring

### Form Component Unification
- [ ] **Standardize form validation** using react-hook-form + zod across all forms
- [ ] **Create reusable form components** (FormField, FormSelect, FormTextarea)
- [ ] **Implement consistent error handling** in all form submissions
- [ ] **Add loading states** to all form submit buttons

### UI Component Enhancement
- [ ] **Audit shadcn/ui component usage** - ensure all components follow design system
- [ ] **Implement consistent spacing** using Tailwind spacing tokens
- [ ] **Add animation consistency** using Framer Motion across all interactive elements
- [ ] **Ensure accessibility compliance** (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast)

### Data Fetching Patterns
- [ ] **Migrate to TanStack Query** for advanced caching and data synchronization
- [ ] **Implement optimistic updates** for better user experience
- [ ] **Add infinite scroll** for large data sets (tasks, projects, categories)
- [ ] **Create data prefetching strategies** for improved performance

## üîí Security & Performance

### Authentication Security
- [ ] **Implement token rotation** for enhanced JWT security
- [ ] **Add session timeout handling** with automatic logout
- [ ] **Secure sensitive data storage** (remove any potential credential exposure)
- [ ] **Add rate limiting** for API calls

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Bundle analysis and optimization** - reduce bundle size where possible
- [ ] **Implement code splitting** for route-based lazy loading
- [ ] **Add image optimization** for blog and memo attachments
- [ ] **Database query optimization** for large datasets

### Error Handling Enhancement
- [ ] **Global error boundary implementation** for better error recovery
- [ ] **Retry mechanisms** for failed API calls
- [ ] **Offline support** for critical functionality
- [ ] **User-friendly error messages** with actionable guidance

## üìö Documentation & Developer Experience

### Code Documentation
- [ ] **Update CLAUDE.md** with new API architecture details ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Add comprehensive JSDoc comments** to all utility functions
- [ ] **Create component usage examples** in Storybook or documentation
- [ ] **Document environment variable requirements** for all integrations

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Set up Jest and React Testing Library** for unit tests
- [ ] **Add Playwright E2E tests** for critical user flows
- [ ] **Implement visual regression testing** for UI consistency
- [ ] **Create API integration tests** for backend communication

### Development Tools
- [ ] **Configure ESLint rules** for TypeScript best practices
- [ ] **Set up pre-commit hooks** for code quality enforcement
- [ ] **Add GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] **Implement automated dependency updates** with Dependabot

## üåç Internationalization & Accessibility

### Translation System Enhancement
- [ ] **Complete Norwegian translations** for all UI text
- [ ] **Implement dynamic content translation** for user-generated content
- [ ] **Add translation management workflow** for content updates
- [ ] **Ensure RTL language support** for future expansion

### Accessibility Improvements
- [ ] **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit** across all pages
- [ ] **Screen reader optimization** for complex interactive elements
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation enhancement** for all functionality
- [ ] **Color contrast validation** across all theme variants

## üöÄ Feature Enhancements

### Task Management
- [ ] **Advanced task filtering and search** with full-text search capabilities
- [ ] **Task dependencies and subtasks** for complex project management
- [ ] **Time tracking integration** for productivity insights
- [ ] **Kanban board view** for visual task management

### Collaboration Features
